# XE475 - Mechatronics
----------
## Introduction
Mechatronics is the integration of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and controls engineering to simulate and design intelligent electro-mechanical systems. The objectives of this course are to:
a. Demonstrate breadth of fundamental mechanical and electrical engineering skills, 
b. Select and implement sensors and actuators to satisfy the performance requirements of a specified task, and explain the role of sensors in measurement systems,
c. Develop mathematical models that represent the governing physics principles of electromechanical subsystems and systems. Use computer models to predict the behavior of engineered systems. Compare predicted behavior to measured behavior.
d. Design, build and test a microcontroller-based or electro-mechanical system.
